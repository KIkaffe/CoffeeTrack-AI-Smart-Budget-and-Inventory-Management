# CoffeeTrack-AI-Smart-Budget-and-Inventory-Management
CoffeeTrack AI er et intelligent budsjett- og lagerstyringssystem designet for kaffefabrikker. Det hjelper med å spore total lagerbeholdning, råvarer, materialer, lønnskostnader og vedlikeholdsutgifter, og gir sanntidsanalyser og optimaliseringstips.
Background
Problem:
Many coffee factories struggle with inefficient inventory management and budget control. Raw materials such as coffee, milk and sugar can be over- or under-ordered, leading to financial losses. In addition, maintenance and labor costs can be difficult to predict without good insight into the overall financial situation of the factory.
How common is this problem?
This is a common problem in the manufacturing and food industries, where margins are often tight, and errors in inventory and financial management can lead to large financial losses.
Personal motivation:
As part of a coffee factory, I see the need for a system that can simplify these processes and ensure that finances are handled efficiently.

Why is this important?
Better inventory management and budget control can lead to lower costs, less waste, and higher profitability.
Data and AI techniques
Data needed:

Stock status of raw materials and materials (coffee beans, packaging, sugar, milk, etc.)
Budget and accounting data
Production volume
Employee salaries and hours worked
Repair and maintenance history
AI techniques:

Machine learning: To predict future needs based on past consumption
Predictive analytics: To suggest optimal orders for raw materials
Automated budget tracking: AI will analyze finances and provide warnings about budget overruns
Anomaly detection: Identify unusual costs or inventory variances
How is it used?
Users:

Finance department: Gets better overview of budget and costs
Warehouse manager: Can predict inventory needs and avoid shortages or surpluses
Production manager: Gets real-time insight into material consumption
Management: Can make better decisions based on AI analytics
How does it work?

The system collects data from inventory, finance, and production
AI analyzes patterns and creates reports
Users receive alerts and recommendations via a simple dashboard app
Challenges
Data quality: If the input data is inaccurate, the AI ​​analyses will be wrong
Implementation cost: Introducing AI can require an initial investment
Usability: The system must be easy to understand and use for factory workers
The way forward
Integrate IoT sensors for automatic inventory updates
Develop a mobile app for real-time alerts and reports
Connect to external market data to optimize raw material purchases based on price changes
Sources and inspiration
Open source AI tools like TensorFlow and Scikit-learn
Financial management systems like SAP and QuickBooks
Production analytics models from large factory systems
